  Hi, I go by Medha. Basically, I'm a software engineer but I also have experience in systems engineering. 
  
  I write code and build softwares that help people work better and make their life easier.

  I believe there's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to face and solve.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
