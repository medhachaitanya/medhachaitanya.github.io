  Hi, I go by Medha. <br /><br />I'm a software engineer but I also have good experience in systems engineering and team management. 
  <br />
  <br />
  I love to code and build softwares that help people work better and make their life easier. I also enjoy team management.
  <br />
  I believe there's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to face and solve.
